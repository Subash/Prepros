title: Using Jade with Prepros
template: index.jade
---

You can compile Jade files with Prepros.

If you save Jade files in `jade` folder the compiled output will be saved in your `html` folder.

You can configure default `css`, `js`, and `html` folders from [project options](projects.html).

If a file imports another file the imported file is not shown in the files list but is watched in background and parent file is compiled whenever change is detected.
