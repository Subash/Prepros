### Installing the App

Installing Prepros is a piece of cake. Just download Prepros [from the front page](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/) and run the executable to install and you are good to go. You don't have to worry about installing anything other than Prepros such as Sass or Compass.

If you are upgrading from older version of Prepros you can just overwrite the previous version with new version without uninstalling.

Overwriting without uninstalling previous version will retain your configurations.

<div class="alert alert-info">Please close the app before installing new version. Not doing so can cause errors.</div>

### Installing Browser Extension for Live Refresh

Currently only Chrome extension is available for Prepros. Click the `Install Chrome Extension` button [on the front page of Prepros website](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/) to install it.
